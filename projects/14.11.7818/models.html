				<h2>The Sk8-Hi was introduced in 1978 as "Style 38," and showcased the now-iconic Vans Sidestripe on yet another innovative silhouette. As only the second model featuring the recognizable marker formerly known as the "jazz stripe," the Sk8-Hi took skate functionality to the next levelâabove the ankle, where skateboarders used and abused their lower extremities the most. 
						The Sk8-Hi not only shielded bones from skateboards catapulted at them but also brought a whole new look to the park</h2>

				<h2>Vans #36, the Old Skool, 
					debuts with the now famous Vans Sidestripe. 
					The Old Skool is Vans' first skate shoe that incorporated leather panels for increased durability. 
					What started as a random doodle by Paul Van Doren was originally referred to as the "jazz stripe" and has become the unmistakable hallmark of the Vans brand.

				<h2>The first Vans model, Style #44, or the Authentic, 
					retailed for less than $5. By the mid-'70s, when the shoes sold for somewhere around the outrageous sum of $8, 
					skaters like Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta, had discovered them. Incredibly, they could buy one pair at a time for half that price, 
					something that made total sense and actually still would if the world were a very different place.
